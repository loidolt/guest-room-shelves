## General Info

I built these floating shelves to solve the immediate storage problem of having two boys in one room (and all their associated stuff) as well as to provide long-term amenities when it eventually becomes a guest room.

The floating shelves provide a modern look, and the shiplap provides a visual anchor in addition to hiding the support blocking I added to ensure both sides of each floating shelf had solid backing. Rounded corners were used to make the space feel more inviting and so that our young boys were not in danger when playing in their room. Due to the nature of the floating shelf design and the rounded corners, the shelves are a hollow construction of 3/4 in maple plywood with a 3d printed radius piece to provide backing to the veneer around the corner.

The shelves are destructive-removal only by design, they will need to be cut off and then unscrewed if we ever want to remove them. This was a compromise made to achieve the strength and relatively thin design I wanted without the wobble caused by a lot of bracket solutions.

The lower shelves are meant to be used primarily for storage of the boys' clothing for now and other items like clean towels and bedding in the future.

The countertop surface gives us a space for diaper changes and a desk surface later.

Outlets were added at each of the upper floating shelves as well as the countertop to provide places to charge things, and connect lights, air cleaners, baby monitors, etc.
